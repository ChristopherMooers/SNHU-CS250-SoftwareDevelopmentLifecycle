# SNHU-CS250-SoftwareDevelopmentLifecycle

This repository contains coursework, exercises, and portfolio artifacts for  
CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Topics Covered
- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Agile and Scrum practices
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Requirements gathering and analysis
- Stakeholder communication
- Software planning and iteration

## Purpose
This repository is part of my academic portfolio and demonstrates my understanding
of modern software development processes and Agile methodologies.

## Sprint Review & Retrospective Reflection

### Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them
During the SNHU Travel project, I learned how important it is to understand user needs before development begins. Creating user stories helped translate those needs into clear, actionable requirements by focusing on what the user wants and why. This approach kept development user-focused and made it easier to prioritize work, clarify expectations, and ensure features delivered real value.

### My Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Practices
I approach developing programs by breaking large problems into smaller, manageable tasks and building them iteratively. Agile practices such as sprint planning, backlog refinement, and retrospectives reinforced this mindset by encouraging flexibility and continuous improvement. These practices helped the team adapt to changes in direction without losing progress, and they are processes I plan to use in future development work.

### Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Being a good team member in software development means communicating clearly, staying accountable, and being open to collaboration. This project highlighted how important it is to support teammates across different roles, ask questions when requirements are unclear, and adjust work based on feedback. Strong communication and teamwork ultimately lead to better outcomes for both the team and the final product.
